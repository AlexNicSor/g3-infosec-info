This repository presents the findings of a study investigating the performance and scalability of various encryption protocols within a simulated group chat environment.

Key Questions Addressed:
  1. How does encryption overhead scale with the number of users in a group chat environment across these different encryption algorithms?
  2. Which encryption method offers the best balance of security, computational efficiency, and scalability for large-scale secure group messaging?
  3. How do group size, input variables, and encryption algorithms collectively impact key management efficiency, message propagation time, and overall system performance?
